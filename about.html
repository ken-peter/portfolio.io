    <p>It's seems like the easiest to write yet it is the hardest. Apparently that is how paradoxical life is. The simplest often are the hardest and vice versa. I can summarise my whole being into one item. I am a person who believes in and embraces positive
      change in the society. Change can take plae in so many different forms, for example, technological transformations, political changes, educational improvements, health improvements, to mention but a few. All these changes create a better environment
      for growth, interaction, and improvement in the standards of living. </p>

    <p>Kennedy Peter Odhiambo is my full name. I was born in a humble family in Pumwani Hospital by loving parents, Mr. Richard Onyango and Mrs. Florence Achieng'. Having a Christian upbringing herself, my mother raised me in a staunch Christian background
      in the Anglican Church where we used to fellowship. At the age of 14, my father left my mother, two siblings and I to the care of my mother who was jobless by then. My elder sister, Rolline Atieno, had to drop out of Multi Media University where
      she was pursuing a course in Mass Communication. I had just done my K.C.P.E Examination and was waiting for a calling letter to join high school. My brother, Collins Obure who was in Standard 6 by then also had to leave school. I received my calling
      letter to Maranda High School but there wasn't any way I could join the school due to shortage of finances. My star of hope even grew even dimmer when all my bursary application forms were rejected. I stayed home for a better portion of the year.
      With my mother's constant words of advice and courage (<em>Though you could always see a look of despair and sorrow in her eyes</em>), I decided to re-sit for my primary school K.C.P.E examinations in 2012. After then I was called to Alliance High
      School. I was lucky enough to get recognised by the area Member of Parliament, Dr. James Nyikal who took care of my shopping expenses and paid for the first term school fee. I constantly sought help until one day, thanks to my History teacher Mdm.
      Okullo and Goegraphy teacher Mrs. Olang', I met my mentors, Mr. Edwin Macharia of Dalberg Global Development Advisors and Mrs. Lorna Irungu of Nation Media Group who have seen me through my studies and ensured I got the best of everything in school
      and even after school. My mother sheds tears of joy whenever she remembers where we were and our current state, thanks to the two God-sent angels. That is my life in a nutshell. If I were to narrate the whole of it I would have filled a whole series
      of novels.</p>

        <li><strong>February 2017 - March 2017</strong></li>
        <p>Learning to code at <a href="http://www.moringaschool.com/" target="_blank">Moringa School</a>.<br>Simply the best time and learning experience ever. It keeps you yearning for more, active, refreshed and psyched up for the following day. I loved
          it.

        <li><strong>February 2013 - November 2016</strong></li>

          was more of life skills other than Exam-passing tactics which made the school outstanding.</p>
        <li><strong>May 2011 - December 2012</strong></li>
        <p>Re-sat for my K.C.P.E Examinations in Alungo Primary School.<br>It is located in Nyanza at a place called Kombewa. I did my standard seven and eight there since standard eight registration had already been done so I had to move a class back.</p>

        <p>Did my primary schooling in Tender Care Junior School.<br>This was the place where I got my strong academic foundation from. Approachable teachers, fantastic learning environment and social children all contributed to my early childhood development.</p>

        <p>I have taken part in several community service schemes mostly incorporating giving back to the community. Mostly I go to various schools and offer gudance and counselling sessions or teach a subject or two. At times I participate in cleaning programmes
          where I visit an institution and clean or help out in other duties available. Here are some of the activities i participated in in the past four years:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>August 2016</strong></li>
          <p>Visited Boston Primary School and offered guidance and counselling to the students in standard eight for a week on preparation for the final examinations and a few question answering techniques.</p>
          <li><strong>April 2016</strong></li>
          <p>Organised and conducted Book Reading Sessions among my friends to boost our reading skills and to improve on our interaction and self-expression skills. Most of them embraced the sessions and are currently into writing.</p>
          <li><strong>December 2015</strong></li>
          <p>Visited the Hidden Talent Children's Home and interacted with the children by making them share their life experiences and air out their viewss and opinions to most of the challenges facing Kenyan families currently. It was and still is one
            one the moments I cherish most.</p>
          <li><strong>August 2013</strong></li>
          <p>Teamed up with a group of students from the Red Cross Society and cleaned Kikuyu Town for a day.</p>
